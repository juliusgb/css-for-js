# Workshops/Exercises for CSS for JS

Contains directories that correspond to the repositories for workshops/exercises of  [Josh Comeau](https://twitter.com/JoshWComeau)'s excellent course, [CSS for JS](https://css-for-js.dev/).

Each workshop/exercise is its own repository. Forking each one clutters my repositories page.

Instead of forking each workshop's repo to add my changes, I'm using [`git grafts`](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-replace#Documentation/git-replace.txt) to stay within one repo while keeping the git history of the upstream repos.

I'll add a directory for each module's workshop/exercise.
